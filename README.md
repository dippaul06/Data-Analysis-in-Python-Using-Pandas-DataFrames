## Data Analysis in Python Using Pandas DataFrames

###  This repo contains my work in the Coursera Guided Project Titled - "Data Analysis in Python: Using Pandas DataFrames"

####  Description of the Project:
In this Project, we explore the famous IMDb Movies dataset. We start with importing our JSON data into a Pandas data frame. After applying some data preparation steps such as dropping and renaming some columns, we start our data analysis by answering some analytical questions about the dataset. This Project focuses on how to use Pandas functions to filter, clean, aggregate, and visualize data.
